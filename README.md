# Week 7 – Python

Part of CS50x 2025 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week introduced Python as a higher-level programming language. We learned how Python simplifies many programming tasks and offers powerful libraries and cleaner syntax compared to C.

## Topics Covered
- Python syntax and structure
- Data types (lists, dicts, tuples, sets)
- Loops and conditionals in Python
- Functions and modules
- File I/O and command-line arguments

## Projects
- DNA
- Movies

## Key Takeaways
- Gained a strong foundation in Python programming.
- Understood how to translate logic from C to Python in a more concise way.
- Leveraged built-in data structures like dictionaries and lists to write cleaner, faster code.

## Challenges
Working with CSV files and manipulating data in the DNA and Movies projects was a great exercise in parsing and using Python’s file handling features. It took time to adapt from C-style thinking to Pythonic approaches.

## How to Run
python file.py
